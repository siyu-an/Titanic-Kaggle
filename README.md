Machine learning algorithms applied on Titanic dataset
# Titanic Survivor Prediction
The Titanic dataset is the one that most machine learning novices on Kaggle start with. The goal for this project is to predict the survival of each passenger given
his/her information. 

Features for each passenger include: Age (in years), Sex, Pclass (Ticket class), SibSp (# of siblings/spouses on board),
Parch (# of parents/ children on board), Fare, Cabin (cabin number), Ticket (ticket number), Embarked (Port of Embarkation) and Name (last name, prefix, first name).

In this project, I applied some basic machine learning algorithms for 
classification like logistic regression, support vector machine as well as ensembled methods like random forest, XGBoost and Voting Classifier. 
Accuracy for test set of each method listed below:
1. Voting classifier -- 77.51%
2. Random Forest -- 77.03%
3. Support Vector Machine -- 76.56%
4. XGBoost -- 74.40%
